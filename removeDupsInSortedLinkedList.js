/*
Description:
Remove Consecutive Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
Write a function "deleteDuplicates" that removes consecutive duplicate nodes in-place, retaining only the first node of each code. Return the head of the resulting list.

Example
Input
head = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation
- Given 1→2→2→2→3→4→4→5. 
- Start at 1 (next is 2, no skip). 
- Move to 2; skip all consecutive 2's so that 2 links directly to 3 (removing two extra 2 nodes). 
- Now list is 1→2→3→4→4→5.
- Move to 3 (next is 4, no skip). 
- At 4, skip the duplicate 4 so it links to 5. 
- The resulting list is 1→2→3→4→5.

Input Format
The first line n contains the length of the linked list
The next n lines contains the elements of the linked list

Example
8
1
2
2
2
3
4
4
5
here 8 is the length of the linked list followed by the nodes of the list.

Constraints
0 <= n <= 1000, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5 for each node in the list
The linked list is sorted in non-decreasing order: for each node u with successor v, u.val <= v.val

Output Format
The function returns one value: the head of the deduplicated list

Sample Input 0
0

Sample Input 1
1
1
Sample Output 1
1
