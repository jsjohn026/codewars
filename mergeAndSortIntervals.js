Description:
Merge and Sort Intervals
Given an array of intervals [startTime, endTime], merge all overlapping intervals and return a sorted array of non-overlapping intervals.

Example
Input
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Output
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Explanation
- Step 1: Sort intervals by start time (already sorted). 
- Step 2: Initialize merged list with first interval [1,3]. 
- Step 3: Compare [2,6] with last merged [1,3]. They overlap (2 â‰¤ 3), so merge into [1,6]. 
- Step 4: Compare [8,10] with last merged [1,6]. No overlap (8 > 6), append [8,10]. 
- Step 5: Compare [15,18] with last merged [8,10]. No overlap (15 > 10), append [15,18]. 

Result: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].

Input Format
The first line contains an integer denoting the number of intervals.
The second line contains an integer denoting the length of individual interval array.
Each of the next N lines contains two space-separated integers startTime and endTime
Intervals may be provided in any order; duplicates and fully contained intervals are allowed.
Example
4
2
1 3
2 6
8 10
15 18
here, 4 is the number of intervals, 2 is the length of individual interval array, followed by the intervals.

Constraints
0 <= intervals.length <= 100000
intervals[i].length == 2 for all 0 <= i < intervals.length
0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < intervals.length

Output Format
Return a 2D array of two space-separated integers start and end, representing the merged intervals sorted by increasing start time.
